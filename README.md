Detecting Fake Reviews and Rating Manipulation on Amazon
- Conducted an examination of fake reviews on Amazon, focusing on the development of machine 
learning models to identify and analyze dishonest customer feedback through python. 
- Collaborated with team members to employe techniques, including K-Means Clustering, 
Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN alongside LDA to assess the effectiveness of different 
clustering approaches in detecting fraudulent reviews.
- Evaluated model performance through metrics such as silhouette scores and the Davies-Bouldin 
Index (DBI) to determine which model is the most reliable for pinpointing fake reviews.
